id=“iframe”>You have methodically done all the preparation your coach and support people have given you to do. A step by step program has been developed to help you achieve mastery of the physical and technical elements of the area you are passionate about. You have enjoyed the challenge of training and rehearsing and seeing yourself improve. You have been able to nail it in practice again and again. Crunch time comes and you need to do your best. People close to you see the hard work you are putting in and reassure you that everything will be alright. You try to reassure yourself but anxiety and self doubt begin to creep in, again. You can’t seem to stop thinking about what could go wrong and those past performances that didn’t go as you planned. We all want to perform at our best, especially when it really matters. The ability to perform consistently under pressure requires a shift in how we mentally prepare to perform and our attitude to mistakes. As we gain self confidence we learn to relax, trust our skills and allow ourselves to move to our optimum performance zone. We are then free to seek out new situations that are both stimulating and challenging. We find our passion when we do what energises us, what we want to do more of and what we are good at. Don’t let unnecessary fear stop you from doing what you are passionate about.</div>
