id=“iframe”>I am a qualified performance coach and counsellor with 10 years of experience working with people who want to focus on wellness and personal performance. Through this I have developed an approach that identifies character strengths and areas that are self limiting beliefs and cause a fixed mindset stopping people from achieving their goals and flourishing. I focus on creating a safe space for people to explore and reflect on their life and a clear structure to facilitate personal growth towards learning and developing confidence, compassion, personal identity and a stronger support network in which to flourish.</div>
